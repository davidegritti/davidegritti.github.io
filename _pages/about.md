Hi! I'm Davide, a quantitative sociologist from Bergamo (Italy). 

I'm a PhD candidate at the School of Social Sciences, University of Trento, and a member of the Center for Social Inequality Studies [(CSIS)](https://r.unitn.it/en/soc/csis). 

I work on topics broadly related to life course, social inequality and family. 
Currently, my main interest is in the intersection between demographic and wealth accumulation and transfer dynamics. See the research section for a more detailed overview of my research agenda.

I have a broad interest in quantitative methods, especially in longitudinal data analysis.
