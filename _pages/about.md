Hi! I'm Davide, a quantitative sociologist from Bergamo (Italy). I'm a PhD candidate at the School of Social Sciences, University of Trento (Italy). 

Currently, my main interest is in the intersection between family structures and dynamics and wealth accumulations and transfers. In other words, I'm interested in material resources (gifts, bequests) flowing within families or differences in families' wealth assets (e.g. homeownership) that can be traced back to different family life courses or events.
More broadly, I've been working on topics related to social stratification and family sociology/social demography. A tempestive summary is in the Research section.

I'm also interested in quantitative methods, particularly longitudinal data analysis, especially social sequence analysis.
