Hi! I'm Davide, a quantitative sociologist from Bergamo (Italy). 

I'm a PhD candidate at the School of Social Sciences, University of Trento, and a member of the Center for Social Inequality Studies [(CSIS)](https://r.unitn.it/en/soc/csis). 

I work on topics related to life courses, social inequality and family sociology. 

Currently, my main interest is in the intersection between family dynamics and wealth accumulation and transfer. In other words, I'm interested in material resources (gifts, bequests) flowing within families or differences in families' assets (e.g. homeownership) that can be traced back to different family life courses or events.

In methodological terms, I'm interested in quantitative methods of social research, particularly longitudinal data analysis, especially social sequence analysis.
